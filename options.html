<br/><br/>Menu Tips:
Midle click and drag tabs in the menu to close multiple tabs.  Drag outside of the menu and release middle mouse button to cancel.  

<br/><br/>
Remember, if you close something accidentally, you can press <b>ctrl-shift-t</b> to reopen closed tabs or right click next to the tab bar to find this feature in the contextual menu.  

<br/><br/>
Tab Tips:
If you do not want to jump to your previous tab when closing your current tab, either dissable the feature above, or select the tab you want before middle clicking the one you want close.  You will not be transported to your last tab when closing tabs with this feature enabled unless you close your currently selected tab.

<br/><br/>
Best Tip:
When chrome requires Manifest Version 3 there is a trick to make this extension work!
<br/><br/>
From this page inspect, and then pick Application, navigat to Serice Workers - and then click the link that starts the worker...
the worker will now STAY LAUNCHED which means it will actually remember what you are doing for your current browser session.
<br/><br/>
You can now use LastTabz somewhat normally (albeit without working screenshot feature except by rare accidental not sure why it sometimes works and other times doesn't now.)
